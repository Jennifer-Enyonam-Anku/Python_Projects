# Python Projects Repository

## ðŸ“Œ About
This repository contains Python projects and scripts showcasing my work in **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **automation**.  
It is designed to be easy to navigate for collaborators, recruiters, and hiring managers.  
The content here demonstrates practical problem-solving skills and the ability to translate concepts into working solutions.

## âœ¨ Highlights
- **Data Analysis & Visualization** â€“ Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing datasets using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.  
- **Machine Learning** â€“ Building and deploying predictive models using Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and other ML libraries.  
- **Automation** â€“ Writing Python scripts to automate repetitive workflows.  
- **Organized Project Structure** â€“  
  - `Datasets/` â†’ Contains raw and processed datasets  
  - `Models/` â†’ Stores trained model `.pkl` files and scalers  
  - `Notebooks/` â†’ Includes Python scripts (`.py`) and Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)  
- **Reproducibility** â€“ Clear folder structure and documented code for easy replication.
