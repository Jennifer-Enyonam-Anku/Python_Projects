# 🧠 HR Exit Predictor

A Streamlit-based machine learning application to help HR professionals **predict employee exit risk** using historical data and predictive analytics.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained with **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to accurately predict the likelihood of employee attrition. The tool is built to support HR teams in:

- Identifying high-risk employees
- Making data-driven retention decisions
- Proactively planning workforce strategies

The model was developed in Python, deployed via Streamlit, and is powered by real-world HR data with feature engineering and model optimization.
